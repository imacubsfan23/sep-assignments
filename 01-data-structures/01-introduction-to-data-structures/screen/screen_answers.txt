* How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
- You can access data from 2 directions (a matrix/2-dimensional array). Very useful for vector geometry (used in many videogames)
* If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?
- screen.matrix[(x-coordinate)][(y-coordinate)]
* What other real-world data can each structure represent?
- A tall building with levels that are all different businesses, Cubby-hole/organization for kindergarteners
