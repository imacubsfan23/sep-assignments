LINE: 
* How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
- Developers can now find the person at the front and remove the person in the front. This will be helpful for queues such as a line, because we want the person who has been "waiting" the longest get their spot on the roller-coaster or whatever first.
* If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?
- If they are searching for a "thrill-seeker" in "roller-coaster-line", they would write 'roller-coaster-line.search(thrill-seeker)' and it would return that thrill-seeker's name, or nil in the case of a thrill-seeker not being in that line.
* What other real-world data can each structure represent?
- A food dispenser, A conveyer belt, A fashion show, A slideshow

SCREEN:
* How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
- You can access data from 2 directions (a matrix/2-dimensional array). Very useful for vector geometry (used in many videogames)
* If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?
- screen.matrix[(x-coordinate)][(y-coordinate)]
* What other real-world data can each structure represent?
- A tall building with levels that are all different businesses, Cubby-hole/organization for kindergarteners
