* Explain why doubling the size of the underlying array of your HashClass may be a poor idea.
- It is possible that if you alter the already existing array, that you may lose or alter existing data. 
  Also, allocating memory is a relatively slow operation. In order to avoid these potential problems, 
  we allocate twice as much memory somewhere else, because it is faster and safer. We then move the data
  to that new location, and remove it from its previous location.
