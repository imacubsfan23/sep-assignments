1. Given the alphabetically sorted collection (A-G) in this checkpoint, 
   how many iterations would it take to find the value G 
   using linear search?
   
   - 7, because the length of the array is 7, 
     and G is the last element
   
2. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, 
   how many iterations would it take to find the value G 
   using binary search?
   
   - 3, because we go from A-G to E-G, 
     then we know that there is only one 
     element larger than our new mid of F, 
     which is our answer G. On the 3rd iteration,
     G becomes our mid value, and we return it.
   
3. Calculate fib(10), fib(11), fib(12) by hand.

   - fib(10) = 34 # 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34
   - fib(11) = 55 # 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55
   - fib(12) = 89 # fib(10) + fib(11)

            LINEAR VS BINARY SEARCH QUESTIONS
----------------------------------------------------------
 
1. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, 
   which algorithm would you choose between linear 
   search and binary search? Would you use an iterative 
   or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.
   
   - I would use an iterative linear search, because binary 
     search only works on sorted lists.
   
2. Given a sorted collection of a million items, 
   which algorithm would you choose between linear 
   search and binary search? Would you use an iterative 
   or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.
   
   - I would use a recursive binary search, because binary
     search is much faster than linear search, and recursive
     algorithms work faster than iteration (in most cases)
