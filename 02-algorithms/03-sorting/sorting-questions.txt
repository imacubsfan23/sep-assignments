-  Speculate on why you think some sort algorithms are faster 
   than others and provide rationale as to your thought process.
   
* Some sort algorithms (such as heap sort in this case) 
  take less time than others, because the more efficient
  algorithms are basically doing less calculations than
  slower ones. For example, in a quicksort, you only pass over
  every item in the array once. In an algorithm such as
  selection sort, however, it could be anywhere from passing
  over 1 time, to up to 2 times through. This can really slow
  a sort down if there are a lot of data to be sorted, and it
  is mixed well.
